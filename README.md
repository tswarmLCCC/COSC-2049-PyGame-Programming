# COSC-2049-PyGame-Programming

Acknowledgements:

This is not our work.  It is based on work ClearCode put into the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk and assocated code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk.

We are using it here to examine game programming and have forked it for maintenance and to allow a LCCC repo that students can pull directly from.
